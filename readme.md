# 6Seeks /s…™ks siÀêks/


## Introduction

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science, pursuing my Ph.D. degree. My research areas include network measurement and cybersecurity within the IPv6 framework. I have evolved the **6Seeks** platform for active measurements in IPv6, strictly for benign purposes and without any malicious or intrusive intent.

## Tools

1. **6Graph**
   - A tool for mining IPv6 address patterns by learning the distribution of known active addresses.
   - Source code available at [Lab-ANT/6Graph](https://github.com/Lab-ANT/6Graph).

2. **6Forest**
   - A tool based on the Isolation Forest concept for IPv6 address generation.
   - Source code accessible at [Lab-ANT/6Forest](https://github.com/Lab-ANT/6Forest).

3. **Treestrace**
   - Optimized for exploring a wide range of IPv6 prefixes, aiming to maximize the collection of IPv6 router interface addresses with limited probing resources.
   - Written in Go and compatible with UNIX-like platforms.
   - Find the source code at [6Seeks/Treestrace](https://github.com/6Seeks/Treestrace).

4. **Sweeper**
   - An improved tool for the collection of IPv6 router interface addresses in the wild, offering greater efficiency and reduced resource usage.
   - Source code can be found at [6Seeks/Sweeper](https://github.com/6Seeks/Sweeper).

5. **YarrpGen**
   - Designed in Go to generate random IPv6 targets across multiple prefixes with specified granularity and even distribution.
   - Source code available at [6Seeks/YarrpGen](https://github.com/6Seeks/YarrpGen).

6. **6Seeks**
   - A Global IPv6 Network Periphery Scanning System
   - Source code available at [6Seeks/6Seeks](https://github.com/6Seeks/6Seeks).

## Data in Our IPv6 Measurement

We are open to sharing the data obtained from our measurement process, which includes active IPv6 addresses, global IPv6 router interface addresses, high-value prefixes, and global IPv6 periphery (CPE) addresses. For privacy protection, prevention of malicious use, and technical limitations with hosting large datasets on GitHub, please reach out via a formal email to request access to our data.
